# AMD vs NVIDIA and Platform Performance Research

## Key Findings Summary

### Important Clarification: AMD Processors vs NVIDIA GPUs
- **AMD processors (CPU)** and **NVIDIA GPUs** are different components
- User has AMD/Intel processors (CPU) + 16GB VRAM (likely NVIDIA GPU)
- The confusion stems from mixing CPU and GPU considerations

### Ollama Performance: Windows Native vs WSL2

**Performance Test Results (RTX 4080, 16GB VRAM):**
- **Windows Native**: 143.68 tokens/s (faster)
- **WSL2 Linux**: 124.37 tokens/s (slower)
- **Performance Difference**: Windows is 10-15% faster

### AMD GPU Support Issues

**Docker + AMD GPU Problems:**
- AMD GPU support in Docker is problematic
- Ollama in Docker with AMD GPU often falls back to CPU
- Performance drops to ~1/10th speed when using CPU fallback
- NVIDIA Docker support is much more mature

### Platform Recommendations

**For NVIDIA GPU (16GB VRAM):**
1. **Windows Native** - Best performance (10-15% faster)
2. **WSL2** - Good performance, better compatibility
3. **Docker** - Works well with NVIDIA Docker runtime

**For AMD GPU:**
1. **Windows Native** - Best option
2. **Linux Native** - Good with proper drivers
3. **Docker** - Avoid (poor AMD GPU support)

## Specific Recommendations for User

Given the user has:
- Windows system
- AMD/Intel processors
- 16GB VRAM (likely NVIDIA GPU)
- Docker available

**Recommended Setup: Windows Native**
- Best performance (10-15% faster than WSL2)
- Full GPU utilization
- Simpler setup and maintenance
- No virtualization overhead

**Alternative: WSL2**
- Good performance (only 10-15% slower)
- Better Linux compatibility
- Easier for development workflows
- Still full GPU access

**Avoid: Docker for AMD GPU**
- Poor AMD GPU support
- Often falls back to CPU
- Significant performance degradation
