Of course. This is a brilliant way to solidify the design. Creating a comprehensive markdown document serves as the official "System Architecture & Design" (SAD) document for your AI Development Team. It will be your single source of truth.
Here is the in-depth markdown file detailing the entire infrastructure, model roles, hierarchy, and operational workflow for your specialized coding team.
The Autonomous AI Development Team: System Architecture & Operational Guide
Version: 1.0
Director: The User
Status: Fully Operational
1. Guiding Philosophy
This system is not a single tool; it is an autonomous AI development agency composed of five specialist models. The core philosophy is built on three pillars:
Specialization: Assigning tasks to the AI agent best suited for the job, ensuring expert-level quality for every request.
Resilience: Implementing a hierarchical fallback system, so that if one agent fails, the task is automatically escalated to another, guaranteeing a response.
Efficiency: Using a lightweight, intelligent router to minimize latency and resource consumption, ensuring a fast and responsive user experience.
The user acts as the Director, providing high-level tasks. The CodingDirector class acts as the Manager, routing tasks and handling the team's internal workflow to produce a final, polished result.
2. High-Level System Architecture
The entire system operates locally, requiring no internet connection post-setup. It is orchestrated by the CodingDirector Python class, which manages the flow of information between the user and the AI team.

3. The AI Team: Roster & In-Depth Roles
3.1. Management Tier
Position: Project Manager (The Router)
Assigned LLM: openhermes:7b (Q4_0 Quantized)
Core Responsibilities:
Triage: Instantly analyze every incoming user prompt.
Classification: Determine the primary intent of the prompt, classifying it as either math or general.
Delegation: Route the prompt to the appropriate specialist or team leader.
Strengths & Rationale:
Low Latency: As a smaller 7B model (~4.1 GB), its primary advantage is speed. It can classify a prompt in milliseconds, making the entire system feel responsive.
Resource Efficiency: It consumes minimal VRAM, acting as a lightweight gatekeeper without impacting the resources needed for the larger, more powerful models.
Task-Specific Excellence: It is a conversational model fine-tuned to understand natural language and follow simple instructions (like classification) reliably and without the "cognitive contamination" of a code-focused model.
3.2. Specialist Division
Position: Quantitative Specialist
Assigned LLM: mathstral:7b
Core Responsibilities:
First Responder for Math: Act as the primary expert for any prompt classified as mathematical, statistical, or algorithmic.
Implementation: Generate code for complex formulas, statistical models, and quantitative analysis.
Explanation: Explain the mathematical concepts behind the code it generates.
Strengths & Rationale:
Domain-Specific Training: Mathstral is specifically fine-tuned on a massive corpus of STEM, mathematics, and scientific literature. Its internal knowledge representation is optimized for mathematical reasoning.
Accuracy: It provides higher accuracy and better explanations for quantitative tasks than general-purpose coding models.
3.3. Core Development Team (Hierarchical)
This team handles all general coding tasks in a cascading workflow, ensuring both speed and quality.
Position: Lead Developer
Assigned LLM: deepseek-coder-v2:16b-lite-instruct (q4_0 Quantized)
Core Responsibilities:
Primary Coder: Handle over 90% of all general-purpose coding requests.
Code Generation: Write new functions, classes, and scripts.
Optimization & Review: Handle standard code optimization and review tasks.
Strengths & Rationale:
MoE Architecture: The "lite" architecture provides the knowledge of a 16B parameter model with the speed and resource profile of a much smaller model, making it the perfect, powerful workhorse.
Instruction-Tuned: The -instruct suffix signifies that it has been specifically fine-tuned to follow commands and act as a helpful assistant, leading to more reliable and well-formatted responses.
Position: Senior Developer
Assigned LLM: codellama:13b
Core Responsibilities:
Primary Fallback: Take over any task that the Lead Developer fails to complete successfully.
Quality Assurance: Provide a reliable, "second opinion" with high-quality, industry-standard code.
Generalist Expert: Handle a wide variety of coding tasks across multiple domains.
Strengths & Rationale:
Robust & Battle-Tested: As a foundational model from Meta, CodeLlama is one ofthe most reliable and well-regarded open-source coding models. It is a known quantity that produces excellent results.
General-Purpose Strength: Its training on a vast and diverse dataset makes it an exceptional generalist, serving as the perfect safety net for the system.
Position: Principal Architect
Assigned LLM: wizardcoder:13b-python
Core Responsibilities:
Final Escalation Point: Handle the most logically complex problems that the other models cannot solve.
Complex Logic & Algorithms: Design and implement intricate algorithms, data structures, and system architectures.
Multi-Step Instruction Following: Deconstruct and execute prompts with complex, multi-layered requirements.
Strengths & Rationale:
"Evol-Instruct" Training: WizardCoder's unique training method makes it unparalleled at understanding and executing complex instructions without losing track of the details. This makes it a specialist in solving difficult logical puzzles.
4. Infrastructure & Setup
The entire system is designed to be self-contained and run locally.
LLM Server (Ollama): The foundation of the system. Ollama serves all the models via a unified, OpenAI-compatible API endpoint at http://localhost:11434. It handles all model storage, memory management, and GPU access.
Project Folder (my_ai_director/): A dedicated folder containing all the Python scripts. The models themselves are not stored here; they reside in Ollama's managed directory.
coding_director.py: Defines the CodingDirector class and the AI team's logic.
utils/local_llm_client.py: The client that configures the openai library to communicate with the local Ollama server.
.env: A configuration file to securely store your custom local API key, keeping it separate from the code.
requirements.txt: A file listing all necessary Python libraries for easy project setup.
5. Usage Example
Interaction with the AI team is managed through the CodingDirector class.
Generated python
# main.py

from coding_director import CodingDirector

# Initialize the Director. This assembles the entire 5-model team.
director = CodingDirector()

# --- Task 1: A mathematical problem ---
# The AI Router will see "Black-Scholes" and route this to Mathstral.
math_prompt = "Provide a Python implementation of the Black-Scholes formula."
math_response = director.get_assistance(math_prompt)
print(math_response)


# --- Task 2: A general coding problem ---
# The AI Router will see "Flask" and "API" and route this to DeepSeek.
general_prompt = "Show me how to create a simple 'Hello, World' API endpoint using Python and the Flask framework."
general_response = director.get_assistance(general_prompt)
print(general_response)
