# Project Brief - Enhanced Elite Coding Assistant with Pydantic AI

## Project Overview

The Enhanced Elite Coding Assistant is an advanced AI-powered development tool that leverages Pydantic AI framework to provide intelligent coding assistance with recursive learning and adaptation capabilities. The system is designed to continuously improve its performance through sophisticated feedback loops and knowledge management.

## Core Requirements

### Primary Goals
1. **Intelligent Code Assistance**: Provide context-aware coding suggestions and solutions
2. **Adaptive Learning**: Continuously improve through user interactions and feedback
3. **Knowledge Management**: Build and maintain a comprehensive knowledge base
4. **Multi-Model Orchestration**: Seamlessly integrate multiple AI models for optimal performance
5. **Recursive Improvement**: Self-optimize algorithms and performance metrics

### Technical Objectives
- Implement Pydantic AI-based agent framework
- Create sophisticated learning and adaptation mechanisms
- Build comprehensive knowledge ingestion and validation systems
- Develop interactive training interfaces
- Establish robust feedback integration tools

## Project Scope

### Phase 5 Focus: Training Interfaces and Knowledge Ingestion Tools
The current phase focuses on creating systems that allow the assistant to:
- Ingest and process various document formats
- Provide interactive training interfaces for knowledge refinement
- Validate and verify ingested knowledge
- Process learning materials efficiently
- Integrate user feedback into the learning pipeline

### Technology Stack
- **Core Framework**: Pydantic AI 0.3.2
